## Call for Papers on Multimodal Imaging for Waste Detection and Sorting

### Themes and Scope of the Challenge
* Organic Waste Sorting
* Robotics
* Multimodal imaging
* AI for Good

The scope of the grand challenge is to explore the recognition of materials through 15-band near infrared (NIR) and single-band thermal images. Multimodal imaging encourages the use of complimentary information to be exploited for a more coherent presentation of scenes. For food waste in particular, information relevant to material is useful. 


### Procedure for Submission Evaluation

A double-blind review process will be used to ensure fairness. Each paper will be reviewed by three reviewers. The tentative reviewers are listed below. Model performance will be measured against classification accuracy and segmentation scores such as mIoU and mAP. The validation dataset will be released at a later date than the training data. Code availability may be requested from participants for replicability.
